# Utilizing Eclat and Apriori to Find Frequent Itemsets in the Chess and Accidents Datasets

This project utilizes the Eclat and Apriori algorithms to find frequent itemsets in the Chess and Accidents datasets.

## Resources

- [Borgelt's Website](https://borgelt.net/fpm.html)
- The precompiled executables for both algorithms are available:
  - `apriori-executable`
  - `eclat-executable`
  
  You can use these executables with the required options. To check the available options, simply run the executable.

- The source code is located in the `Eclat-Apriori-Christian-Borgelt` folder. The packages here contain uncompiled C code.

## Datasets

The two datasets used for this implementation are located in the `Datasets` folder:

1. **Chess Dataset**: [chess.dat](http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/chess.dat)
2. **Accidents Dataset**: [accidents.dat](http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/accidents.dat)

## Documentation

A PDF file is included, which contains details and results of the implementation, as well as a comparison of the performance of the two algorithms.
